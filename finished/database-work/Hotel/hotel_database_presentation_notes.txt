Plan for presenting database
----------------------------

draft 1
1. pre-work
	a. working as a group again
		-since flooring mastery
		-looking forward -- more to say about group work later				
	b. planning the system
		-show last working draft of 		
	c. knowign where to draw the line for a minimum viable product

2. the erd
	a. choosing a place to start
		-Gordian knot
		-"Branch"
			*many things depend on the branch
				-room number is meaningful in the context of a branch
	b. show a few relationships btw tables and how to interpret
			*showing why tables are made
				reason 0: it's clearly its own entity
					eg room
				reason 1: more than one table depends on a table attribute
					eg address -- could leave address in as an attribute of 
								  person and branch separately, but then you're
								  duplicating data
				reason 2: a table attribute has attributes that are meaningful
					eg room and roomtype		
				reason 3: a table can be made from which others will inherit attributes
					eg Person and Customer/Guest/Employee
				reason 4: keeping historical data
					eg 
				reason 5: bridging a many to many relationship
					
	c. trace a query
		-
3. the queries
	a. show three queries -- #4, #8, #9
	b. describe some of the problems we realized too late
4. what to do better next time
	a. prep work
		-not starting together
			* ownership of the prep work --> familiarity with relationships
		-not knowing the work would be so rigorous until after most of the planning was done
		-not using the whiteboard to show connection
			*possibly using Workbench from the beginning to show connections?
		-not researching the domain more thoroughly (tax, reservations, bills -- what info they contain?)
			*get samples of each thing, or an entire sample database if possible
		
	b. planning the work flow
		-talking through the requirements of the project
		-knowing which parts of our work need to be the same
			*analyzing the project for spots where we need to work 
			 together and where we can split parts up
				-splitting prep work
				-splitting data generation
				-splitting query writing
		-mini code/work reviews
			*everybody does every type of work, just less of it
			*demonstrate our understanding to each other
			*practice presentation
