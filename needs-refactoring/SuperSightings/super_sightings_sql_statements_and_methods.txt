#Methods
each dao needs crud

the sql statements each need a new method
eg in superPersonsDao, need getSuperPersonsByOrganzation

Unit tests must fully test all create, read, update, and delete functionality for all entities and test all many-to-many and one-to-many relationships in the database.

//what does it mean to test a relationship? since we are doing this the simpler way, i guess it just means we need to 
test the service layer methods too
