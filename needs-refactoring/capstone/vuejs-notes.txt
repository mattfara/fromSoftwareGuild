questions about vue.js

DISPLAY CONTROL



1. do i need to keep the display="style:none;" in the forms and tables?
	i can find out right after I use the v-on
	
	strategy -- set up some data in the vue instance falses initially, and set up v-show on that variable
	on click for the buttons switch the boolean!

	works for one case - displaying a form

	NOTE: anything that gets touched by Vue.js needs to be i the div specified in the el property

	we need a computed property -- when one of these fuckin buttons is clicked, all of the boolean data associated to the button is switched to true, but all others are switched to false. 1. set all to false, 2. set the one passed in as true

	DEBUGGING TIP: look for missing commas between objects, etc


2. how do i add attributes to divs -- like "open" to dialog

AJAX-ish shit
